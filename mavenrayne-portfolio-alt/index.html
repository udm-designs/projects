                            I care deeply about people. That care shows up in 
                            everything I do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m an interdisciplinary designer working across 
                            interior architecture, graphic design, and fine arts. I 
                            approach each project as parts of a whole shaped by the 
                            way humans live and interact. I’m always thinking about 
                            how people move through and use spaces, how they feel 
                            within them, and how design can support, not complicate, 
                            their daily lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sustainability, accessibility, and functionality are not 
                            trends to me; they are responsibilities. I don’t believe 
                            in choosing between beauty and purpose, or creativity 
                            and rigor. The work that matters most to me holds both. 
                            I’m drawn to projects that are intentional, 
                            community-oriented, and grounded in care for the people 
                            who will live with them long after the design phase is 
                            over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I design the way I live: with intention, accountability, 
                            curiosity, and a deep commitment to the people around 
                            me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My process is collaborative and iterative. I value 
                            honest critique, thoughtful questioning, and work that 
                            evolves through care and attention rather than urgency. 
                            I bring my whole self to what I do; not to be expressive 
                            for my own sake, but because good design is never 
                            disconnected from the person creating it or the people 
                            it’s being created for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the core of my practice is a simple goal: to create 
                            spaces and experiences that feel warm, grounded, and 
                            genuinely welcoming. Places where people feel safe, 
                            supported, and at home.
